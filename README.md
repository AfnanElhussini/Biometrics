 <b> This course covers topics related to the science for determining a person's identity by measuring his/her physiological characteristics. Technologies are
being developed to verify or identify individuals based on measurements of the face, hand geometry, iris, retina, finger, ear, voice, speech, signature, lip motion, skin reflectance, DNA, and even body odor. This course will explore the latest advances in biometrics as well as the machine learning techniques behind them. Students will learn how these technologies work and how they are sometimes defeated </b> <br>
